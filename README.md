# Welcome to CineArchive: A Personal Movie Database System

The objective of this project is to design and implement a logging system for their movies, backed by a reliable relational database. Specifically, the system aims to store and organize comprehensive information about each title, including metadata such as genre, rating, duration, release date, language, director, and main cast. It also aims to support accurate and efficient input and updates through SQL-based operations. It should also enable users to organize content by their viewing status and preferences.

It will allow users to record which titles they have watched or intend to watch, thereby enhancing their ability to plan and personalize their viewing experience. Additionally, the system will feature a basic recommendation mechanism based on the userâ€™s viewing history to assist in content selection. Core technical goals include the development of a well-structured relational database, implementation of essential SQL scripts for data management, and integration of a user-facing application interface.



## DEV NOTES:
Hi guys idk what I'm doing but we ball XD
We'll need to be putting important information in this file pertaining to the requirements and instructions on getting the project to run on your pc in the area above. 
I'll also be adding a sort of TODO list below too.

05/01 - Made the prerequisite file stucture based on the tutorials, not at all functional, just trying to get the foundation for our project right. Don't try to run main.py it wont work XD

### IMPORTANT:
** BTW when you guys make changes/commit please add a summary of the changes u guys made for easier progress tracking and documentation. 

** I setup a virtual environment so that hopefully all the necesarry modules will come installed with the repo meaning you guys wont have to install anything but let me know if there are issues. You might have to sellect to run on the venv on vscode idk

** To import the sql file (CineArchive-dump.sql), run this command:
`mysql -u root -p CineArchive < cinearchive_dump.sql`

** Please follow the steps listed in the .env.example file

** As of now, the sql file is a placeholder, i need to change it to correspond to the movies dataset

### TODO:
Everything lmao jk I've just made the basic file stucture that we'll probably be using for our project. So everything else is on the table. Feel free to update as we go along:

** Create the views (the pages of our project) based on the [YT Flask tutorial](https://youtu.be/dam0GPOAvVI?si=ckB3nZ6AM8Zqutgt). 

** Create the html+css website templates for said views (again refer to that same vid)

** Basically, everything else front-end related

** For back-end, wait for me to get the database up and working XD (or do it for me if ur crazy ig)
